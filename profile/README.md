### Empowering Engineers with MDO & MBSE

Welcome to the official OptimiSE GitHub page, where we provide open-source tools, resources, and learning materials to support engineers in mastering Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation (MDO) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).

### About OptimiSE

At OptimiSE, we believe systems modelling and design optimisation should be accessible to every engineering team and embraced as a standard practice throughout complex systems development. We help teams apply these methods through partnered projects, workflow integrations and practical, hands-on learning via our Corporate Training Programmes and online Udemy courses.
